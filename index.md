Welcome to the community hub for the Roman all-sky survey!

This site will host information about the survey, how to get involved, and relevant updates. (Site under construction)

The vision for an all-sky survey was first outlined in a [community white paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230611784H/abstract) co-authored by more than 200 scientists. Building on that foundation, we are now working together to design a General Astrophysics Survey that would deliver all-sky imaging at 0.1″ resolution within the 5-year mission, reaching H ≈ 25 AB mag or W ≈ 26 AB mag.

Combined with Euclid in the Northern hemisphere and LSST in the Southern, this survey would enable infrared colors, morphological star-galaxy separation, and improved proper motions of faint stars by extending the _Gaia_ time baseline.

# Get Involved

The Roman All-Sky Survey is a **community-driven effort**, with broad participation from scientists across institutions, career stages, and research areas. Whether you're interested in survey science, data analysis, theory, or outreach, there's a place for you in this collaboration.
