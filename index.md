title: Roman All-Sky Survey

Welcome to the community hub for the Roman all-sky survey!

This site will host information about the survey, how to get involved, and relevant updates. (Site under construction)

The current survey design would deliver all-sky imaging at 0.1″ resolution, reaching H ≈ 25 AB mag or W ≈ 26 AB mag.

Within the framework of the General Astrophysics Survey, we propose a single-epoch, single-band survey during the nominal Roman mission. Combined with Euclid in the Northern hemisphere and LSST in the Southern, this survey would enable infrared colors, morphological star-galaxy separation, and improved proper motions of faint stars by extending the _Gaia_ time baseline. Critically, without establishing this first-epoch all-sky reference, Roman will be unable to measure meaningful proper motions across much of the sky in an extended mission. Thus, the first epoch lays the foundation for Roman-only proper motions, colors, and enhanced shape measurements through second-epoch imaging.
